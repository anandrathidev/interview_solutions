Difference between semaphore and mutex synchronization 
1. mutex Unlike a semaphore, only one process may hold mutex at one time and only the owner of a mutex may release or unlock it. 
2. The semaphore synchronization primitive forces rescheduling of processes which are in waiters list. 
The implementation of mutex lock API allows to avoid this situation and as a result expensive context switches.
